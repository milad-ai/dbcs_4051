# **Course Objectives**
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **database management systems (DBMS)** and their role in modern data-driven applications. It covers the **fundamentals of database theory**, **conceptual and logical design**, and **data access and manipulation** while emphasizing **best practices** for modeling, implementation, and optimization.

Students will gain proficiency in **relational database concepts** through **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**, mapping ER diagrams to **relational schemas**, and formulating complex **SQL queries** for real-world analytical tasks.

The course also introduces key **data concepts and ethical considerations**:  

- Understanding the **data hierarchy (DIKW pyramid: Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom)**.  
- Introducing **bias and basic ethical issues** in working with data, along with emerging concepts such as **dataism**.  
- Learning the **four levels of data analytics**: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.
  
Beyond the fundamentals, the course introduces **modern trends and tools** in database management, such as:

- **Embedded and analytical databases** (e.g., DuckDB) for fast local processing.
- **Analytical vs transactional systems**: understanding **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** vs **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**.
- **Data Warehouse** vs **Data Lake** vs **Lakehouse** architectures: understanding their differences, purposes, and how they integrate in modern data ecosystems.
- **Introduction to NoSQL databases** (e.g., MongoDB) and understanding when to choose them over relational systems.
- **Query optimization and indexing** for improved performance in large datasets. 
- **Big Data frameworks** (e.g., PySpark) for large-scale data analytics.  
- **Vector Databases** and their role in **AI-driven semantic search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, including a **pgvector tutorial** demonstrating how to integrate vector search into PostgreSQL for similarity queries and AI use cases.
- **Integration with visualization tools** (Power BI) and **web applications** (Streamlit) for presenting insights interactively.

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Introduce fundamental concepts, terminology, and applications of databases.  
- Design ER models for simple applications and convert them into relational tables.
- Differentiate between **OLAP and OLTP systems** and understand their real-world use cases.
- Compare Data Warehouse, Data Lake, and Lakehouse approaches and determine when each is most effective.
- Formulate SQL queries effectively for data retrieval and manipulation.  
- Compare relational approaches with **NoSQL** paradigms and understand their trade-offs.
- Learn to connect databases with **Python** and perform **data analysis with Pandas and PySpark**.  
- Perform **data extraction, transformation, and visualization** to support business decisions.


The primary hands-on environment will be **PostgreSQL**, supplemented by **DuckDB, Marimo notebooks, and Power BI**, providing both industry-standard and cutting-edge perspectives on database management.

In the final project, students will design and implement a complete database system from conceptual modeling to relational implementation, accompanied by an interactive analytical dashboard and a simple web application for data exploration and reporting.

## **Homework Assignments**

You will have five sets of homework assignments, which together carry a total of 5 points. These assignments include both theoretical and practical exercises to help reinforce your learning throughout the course (See the [homework page](https://dbcs.ir/assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

## Homework Submission Instructions

{% include image.html url="/_images/Annotation 2025-08-05 113141.png" width=450 align="right" %}
Please follow the instructions to turn in your homework:  

- Homeworks must be submitted electronically.  
- The **subject line of your email** must follow this naming scheme:  
  - `HW<2-digits homework number>_<LastName>_<FirstName>`  
  - For instance, my first homework would be called: `HW01_Vazan_Milad`  
  - 📧 Send your homework to **hw@dbcs.ir**

⚠️ **Important:** Emails with this exact subject format will receive an automatic confirmation reply upon submission. If you do not receive this confirmation within **five minutes**, it means your email was not received.  

> The **deadline** for each assignment will be **announced separately**. An **automatic reminder** will be sent **one day before the deadline** to the email address you provided to the instructor during the **first session**.

> If the **deadline is extended**, students who have **not submitted** their assignment will receive another **automatic email** **one day before the new deadline**.



## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" [midterm](https://dbcs.ir//exams), while the second will be a [final exam](https://dbcs.ir//exams) scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

**Attendance is required**, and exceeding four absences may result in a penalty of up to 2 points off your total grade. Active participation in both in-class activities and the online message board is highly encouraged.

# **Grading**
- Class attendance and participation: **2** points 
- Homeworks: **5** points
- Final project: **5** points 
- Midterm exam: **3** points
- Final exam: **5** points 


## **Seeking Assistance**

Here are the available help resources, organized by the urgency of your issue:

### **Messaging**
Our course will utilize a Telegram group (link to be provided in class) as the primary communication platform for announcements and discussions. This is an ideal space for asking questions that can be answered by anyone. It's best to use this resource for non-urgent inquiries.

### **Talk with the Instructor**
For any issues at all, please reach out to the instructor:

- Speak with me before class  
- Raise your hand or speak up during class

## **Required Tools and Accounts**
